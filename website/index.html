                    <h1 class="section-title ">Our Story</h1>

                    <div class="section-paragraph">
                        <p>It is with much excitement that we share with you that after time in discernment, we are
                            planning to spend a year in Mbeya, Tanzania serving as missionaries in the Konde
                            Diocese.</p>

                        <p>Our home church, Zion Lutheran East Petersburg, is in Christian partnership (along with
                            our Synod) with Forest Lutheran Church in Tanzania. For the past decade our
                            congregations’ partnership has come in the form of prayer, giving and receiving of
                            gifts, and financial support. For a number of years we have discussed the depth and
                            Christian nature of this relationship. We both strongly feel that to be in true
                            partnership, we are to be present in our relationship.</p>

                        <p>Over the past year and half, we have been discerning what we feel is a call to serve in
                            the Konde Diocese in Tanzania. We have been to several meetings with our Synod’s Konde
                            committee to gather information to determine if this is the right choice for us and our
                            family. After many meetings, conversations, and prayer together, we have decided that
                            serving in Tanzania is a true call and we are committed to following that call.</p>

                        <p>We have been formally invited to serve in the Konde Diocese beginning in the summer of
                            2016 for one full year. Our invitation has been extended from the Bishop Israel-Peter
                            and the Provost from the Science & Technology University in Mbeya (where Forest Lutheran
                            is located). We will both be teaching classes, and in return, have been offered free
                            faculty housing on campus. Angie will be teaching English and volunteering time with
                            Forest Lutheran serving in ministry with families and youth. Andrew will be teaching
                            computer science courses at the university and working with professors to help them
                            advance their programs to better meet the global IT market. Andrew will also be working
                            with hospitals and medical professionals and serving as a conduit to the medical
                            community in Lancaster County and Pennsylvania.</p>

                        <p>Our time in missionary service will also include developing relationships with Lancaster
                            County schools and schools in Mbeya. We have already begun taking steps with our
                            children’s school, East Petersburg Elementary, to establish a relationship with schools
                            in Tanzania. The children from both schools will be able to share real-time and recorded
                            experiences. This benefits the kids of both the Tanzanian and American schools.
                            Educational, cultural, and life experiences can be easily shared and learned from one
                            another through the advances of technology.</p>

                        <p>Beyond the responsibilities of teaching, we will be very active in service and in
                            relationships with the Lutheran church. We will be learning how we can better strengthen
                            our relationship and support among the churches, learning how our Synod can help support
                            free trade, and overall how we can all learn and benefit from our faith based
                            relationship.</p>

                        <p>Our children; Henry 11, Lucy 8, and Wyatt 5, are excited about this adventure – what kid
                            wouldn’t be excited about visiting Africa!? However, we feel as though they should have
                            some responsibility as well. Their interactions with other children will no doubt leave
                            an impression on those they meet. Our children, just by virtue of play and conversation
                            will be installing first world ideas and thoughts into the minds of their third world
                            peers. Those ideas can grow into realties that we cannot imagine today. We are excited
                            about the impact our children will have on the lives of the children in Mbeya, and we’re
                            excited about what this experience will do for our children spiritually.</p>

                        <p>In preparation for our trip, we are diligently working to conserve funds for travel and
                            our living expenses by building our savings, and reducing debt and expenses, including
                            selling our vehicles. Even with these measures, we need to raise $30,000 to support our
                            family’s mission work for the year in Tanzania. We are selling t-shirts and planning
                            community fundraisers, like the Isaac’s dinner you may have attended, and we are asking
                            for generous support from grant funders, businesses, congregations, family, friends, and
                            caring people like you.</p>

                        <p>We will be keeping you all posted on our planning efforts throughout the year and while
                            we are overseas, we will be maintaining a website that we will document our experiences
                            and our work. You can follow our journey at www.hammermission.org.</p>

                        <p>Thank you for your prayers and generous support of our mission work.</p>

                        <p>Peace, <br>Andrew &amp; Angie Hammer<br>Henry, Lucy, &amp; Wyatt</p>
